Notes on learning ASP.NET
-------------------------

 1. Installation: I ran the pkg to install it, then chown'd the relevant
    files (/usr/local/share/dotnet) and added that directory to my PATH. Not
    clear to me why the installer didn't do that, but here we are!
 2. Getting it running! Using `dotnet run` worked right off the bat. Phew.
 3. Changing Pages/Index.cshtml worked great. Next up: learning how that
    date function call works.
 4. Once hello world worked, I noticed a ton of files had changed that I
    originally had under version control. Oops! Went and found the
    github-recommended .gitignore for visual studio, which helped a ton. Also
    used `git -rm -r --cached on lib and obj directories. At a first
    glance, `git ls-tree --full-tree -r --name-only HEAD` seems to contain
    (mostly?) files that we care about for the project.
